title: Conflux PoS Validators - Pools List
---

[Conflux PoS Validators](https://www.conflux-pos-validators.com/) is a third-party application that compiles a list of PoS staking pools on the Conflux network. Its purpose is to centralize information on the different staking pools that secure the Conflux network, and anyone can add their pool to the list by following the instructions provided.

Although it has not been developed by the Conflux team, it has been awarded with a [Conflux Grant](https://forum.conflux.fun/t/conflux-pools-validators-list/14258) . The application is open-source, and anyone can contribute to its development.

However, users should exercise caution as the application is not affiliated with the staking pools and is not responsible for lost or blocked tokens. Users are encouraged to read the contract themselves before depositing their CFX onto one of the pools. Additionally, alerts are displayed on the application for pools whose contract has not been verified on Conflux scan. A warning about staking risks can be found [here](https://forum.conflux.fun/t/pos-mining-pool-risk-warning/13760).
