## 简介

Welcome to the Conflux Contribution Reward Guidelines. Our mission is to build a robust, accessible, and community-driven platform, and your contributions are integral to achieving this vision. Whether you are an experienced developer, a technical writer, a first-time contributor, or simply an enthusiast, your insights, ideas, and improvements can make a significant impact. Understanding that every effort put toward enhancing the Conflux environment deserves recognition, we've implemented a reward system based on FansCoin (FC).

This article details how your contributions, categorized under 'Issues' and 'Pull Requests', are rewarded. You will learn how identifying problems or presenting enhancements in various aspects—ranging from formatting and readability to error identification—is rewarded. With your support, Conflux continues to evolve and improve by the day.
