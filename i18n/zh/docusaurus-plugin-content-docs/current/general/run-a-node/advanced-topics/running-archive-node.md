Conflux archive nodes store the entire history of the Conflux blockchain. This allows them to serve historical data to other nodes and applications.

### 1. 硬件要求

#### Hardware Requirements for Archive Node

* At least 32GB of RAM.
* A minimum of 2TB free disk space (SSD is recommended).
* A stable internet connection.

#### File Limit

Open Files Limit: It's recommended to set the maximum number of open files to 10,000. On Linux, the default is 1,024, which may be insufficient. 您可以在Linux终端使用如下命令设置该参数。

```shell
ulimit -n 10000 
```

### 2. Configuring the Node

Conflux nodes can be configured using either CLI options or a configuration file. If there's a discrepancy between the CLI flags and the config file, **the CLI takes precedence**.

#### 2.1 Using Configuration File

The configuration file follows the TOML format.

The path for the configuration file can be set using the CLI option -config path/to/hydra.toml.

A default configuration file named **hydra.toml** is provided in the **run** directory, which can be used as a starting point for customization.

Set the **node_type** parameter in the configuration file to "archive":

```toml
node_type = "archive" 
```

#### 2.2 CLI Options

List all CLI options by running $ ./conflux --help.

Most CLI options map to a setting in the TOML file. For instance, -public-address 127.0.0.1:32323 can be set in the config file under public_address.

### 4. Running the Node

Start the node with the custom configuration file:

```shell
conflux --config ./run/hydra.toml 
```
