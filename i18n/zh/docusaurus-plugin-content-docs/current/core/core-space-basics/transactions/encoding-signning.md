After every field of a transaction is prepared, following steps are required before it can be sent to network (don't worry, these steps are already implemented by wallets or SDKs):

1. Prepare hash for signing: do [RLP encoding](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) in the order of `[nonce, gasPrice, gas, to, value, storageLimit, epochHeight, chainId, data]` and then apply the `keccak256` operation to the encoded result to obtain a hash.
2. Signing: sign the hash obtained in the previous step using the **private key of the sending account** and perform the ecdsaSign signature operation to obtain the values for `r, s, v`.
3. Transaction Encoding: Do RLP encoding in the order of `[[nonce, gasPrice, gas, to, value, storageLimit, epochHeight, chainId, data], v, r, s]` and convert it into a hexadecimal string.

### Broadcast to the network

After completing the above steps, you will obtain a hex-encoded rawTx. You can then use the [`cfx_sendRawTransaction`](../../build/json-rpc/cfx-namespace.md#cfx_sendrawtransaction) method to send it to the network. Upon a successful invocation of this method, a transaction hash will be returned, which can be used to query the status of the transaction.
