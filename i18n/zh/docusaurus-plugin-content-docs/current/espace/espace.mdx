Conflux eSpace is an independent space that runs on the same underlying infrastructure as the [Core](../core/core.mdx) space. Conflux eSpace has fully compatible interface with Ethereum, so dApps of Ethereum can be directly deployed to eSpace without any modification. 以太坊的开发工具、SDK、钱包和服务可以直接在eSpace中使用。
