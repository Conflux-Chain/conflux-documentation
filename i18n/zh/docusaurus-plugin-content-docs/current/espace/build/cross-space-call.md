[CIP-90](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/CIPs/blob/master/CIPs/cip-90.md) introduces the internal contract [CrossSpaceCall](../../core/learn/core-space-basics/internal-contracts/crossSpaceCall.md) in **Core Space**, allowing for the seamless transfer of CFX and data between two spaces.

With CrossSpaceCall, it becomes feasible to directly engage with eSpace contracts from within Core Space. This functionality provides eSpace developers with the tools they need to create versatile cross-space applications. For a deeper understanding of this concept, you can explore the following resources:
