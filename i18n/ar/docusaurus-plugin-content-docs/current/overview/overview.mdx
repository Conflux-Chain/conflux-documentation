# Documentation Overview

Welcome to the Conflux Network Developer Portal! This comprehensive portal is designed to guide you through the complexities of Conflux Network, a high-performance, decentralized blockchain network. Here, you'll find detailed summaries of the platform's foundational concepts, tools, and guidelines.

Conflux Network have two spaces: [Core Space and eSpace](/docs/overview/space-intro), the develop experience of Core Space and eSpace are different, check docs below for how to start build on each space.

If you have any questions regarding the documentation, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-documentation/issues), send feedback emails to [build@confluxnetwork.org](mailto:build@confluxnetwork.org) or join our <DiscordLink>Discord channel</DiscordLink>  to engage in discussions with us.
