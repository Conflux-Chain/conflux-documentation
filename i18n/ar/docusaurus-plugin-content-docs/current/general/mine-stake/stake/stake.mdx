Conflux utilizes PoS mechanism to counter 51% attacks and thereby introduces finality for its PoW chain. In PoS, validators stake their tokens to participate in the consensus process, also **are rewarded** for their participation in the consensus process.

Validators are selected to vote on **Tree-Graph** pivot blocks. The more tokens a validator stakes, the higher the chance they will be selected to vote on pivot blocks, and the more rewards they will receive.

The current annual reward rate of the Proof of Stake (PoS) is **10%-14%**, and it is influenced by the total staking amount. The lower the staking amount, the higher the yield. The annual return rate calculation method is in here: [Annual Return Rate Calculation Method](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/pos_overview#accrued-interest).

To participate in the PoS consensus process, there are two ways:

- [Become a Solo Validator](./become-a-solo-validator)
- [Stake Through a PoS Pool](./pos-pools-list)

If you also want to run a PoS Pool, you can refer this doc:

- [Running a PoS Staking Pool](./running-staking-pool)

No matter which way you choose, it's better to understand the staking risks:

- [Staking Considerations](./staking-considerations)
