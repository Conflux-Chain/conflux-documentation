# Transferring Funds Across Spaces

## ConfluxHub

The easiest way to transfer assets between Core Space and eSpace is to use [ConfluxHub](https://confluxhub.io/espace-bridge/cross-space). We recommend that you set up two wallets: [Fluent](https://fluentwallet.com/) for Core Space and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for eSpace.

Follow these steps to make a cross-space transfer:

- Start by clicking on `Connect Wallet` to connect your Fluent and MetaMask wallets to ConfluxHub.
- `To: Conflux eSpace` at the top shows that you are making a transfer from Core Space to eSpace. If you would like to make a transfer in the other direction, click on the arrow next to this text.
- In the `Conflux eSpace Destination Address` field, type in your eSpace address or click the MetaMask icon on the right to fill this field automatically.
- Next, select the token that you want to transfer and enter the transfer amount.
- If the button on the bottom says `Approve`, click on it to submit an ERC20 token approval first.
- Once the button on the bottom says `Transfer`, click on it to make the transfer.

Making a cross-space transfer from eSpace to Core Space follows a similar process but it has two main steps: First, transfer the token to the bridge on eSpace. Second, withdraw the token from the bridge on Core Space. Please follow the site’s instructions.

**⚠️ When making a cross-space transfer, always double check your addresses to avoid accidental asset loss.**
