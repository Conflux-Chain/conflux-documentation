:::note

Contributor POAPs operate distinctly from [FC reward guidelines](./reward-guidelines.md). The FC guidelines offer incentives proportional to the contributors' work volume, while POAPs serve as a testament to sustained engagement.

:::

After the end of each quarter, we issue a batch of Contributor POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) to recognize individuals who have made contributions to our documentation site. To be eligible for minting a POAP, your contribution must meet the following "ACCEPTED" criteria:

- Creation of an issue that has been labelled "ACCEPTED" by the repo maintainter.
- Successful merging of a Pull Request into the main branch.
- Full review and approval of a translation string.

**POAP Contract Addresses:**

- **Core Space:** [cfx:acd97pbhxm11cegrz3anuuvcuj9j0nh956a108f5cc](https://www.confluxscan.io/address/cfx:acd97pbhxm11cegrz3anuuvcuj9j0nh956a108f5cc)
- **eSpace:** [0x500371e7ec0b5bca911a11964300e694bb0fec9d](https://evm.confluxscan.io/address/0x500371e7ec0b5bca911a11964300e694bb0fec9d)

These POAPs, deployable in both Core Space and eSpace, function as a unified NFT, symbolizing your valuable contribution across the Conflux network.

## Special POAPs

In addition to the regular contributor POAPs, we recognize and reward significant contributions with special POAPs. Examples of significant contributions include high-quality guides or consistent, frequent contributions to the project. The decision to award a special POAP is made on a case-by-case basis by the project maintainers.

## FC (FansCoin) Rewards for POAP Holders

As a token of appreciation, contributors can claim [FansCoin (FC)](https://confluxscan.io/token/cfx:achc8nxj7r451c223m18w2dwjnmhkd6rxawrvkvsy2) rewards for each POAP they own. The amount of FC awarded varies depending on the specific POAP.

This is the attached reward with POAP, and do not make impact on rewards relating to [reward guidelines](./reward-guidelines.md).

> Please note that the FC reward pool is located exclusively in Core Space at [cfx:achm6kb92by13rpvwd04zscn1127zuaseu25usm7sc](https://confluxscan.io/address/cfx:achm6kb92by13rpvwd04zscn1127zuaseu25usm7sc).

## Regular Review of POAP Issuing Rules

Please note that the POAP issuing rules are subject to review and possible changes every 3 months. This ensures that our guidelines remain relevant and effective in promoting and rewarding valuable contributions.

We look forward to your contributions and thank you for helping us improve our documentation site! If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to create an issue in our Github repo.
