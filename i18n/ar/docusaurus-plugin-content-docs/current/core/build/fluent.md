[Fluent Wallet](https://fluentwallet.com/) is a browser extension wallet supported by the Conflux Foundation, designed to provide convenient and secure digital asset management services for Conflux users. Fluent Wallet supports Conflux Core Space and eSpace while also offering connectivity to other EVM-compatible chains.

Fluent Wallet provides [integration documentation](https://docs.fluentwallet.com/conflux/) for Conflux Core Space dApp developers, which includes use cases for connecting wallets and RPC API content. Developers can complete the integration process by following the relevant documentation.
