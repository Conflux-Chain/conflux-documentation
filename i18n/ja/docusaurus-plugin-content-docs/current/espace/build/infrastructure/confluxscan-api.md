[ConfluxScan](https://evm.confluxscan.org/) is a block explorer for the Conflux network, just like Etherscan for Ethereum. It provides a [**RESTful API**](https://evmapi.confluxscan.org/doc) for developers to query **aggregated blockchain data**. The API is free to use and compatible with the [Etherscan API](https://etherscan.io/apis).

## Usage Scenarios

If you want get data like these:

- The transaction history of an address
- The NFTs owned by an address or a contract
- The ERC20 tokens owned by an address or a contract
- The ERC20 token transfer history of an address or a contract
- Verify the source code of a contract, get the ABI of a contract
- Query block number by timestamp

Then you can use the ConfluxScan API to get the data you want. For a complete list of API endpoints, see [API swagger doc](https://evmapi.confluxscan.org/doc).

## API Endpoints

The API endpoints are listed below:

- Mainnet: `https://evmapi.confluxscan.org`
- Testnet: `https://evmapi-testnet.confluxscan.org`
