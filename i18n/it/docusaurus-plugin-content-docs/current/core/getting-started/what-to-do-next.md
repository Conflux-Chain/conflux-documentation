After installing your wallet and finish your first transaction by claiming CFX in testnet faucet, you may wonder what to do next. Here are some suggestions and links to help you explore the Conflux network and its ecosystem.

- **Learn more about Conflux**. If you want to learn more about Conflux's technical principles and architecture, you can refer to the [Core Space Basics](/docs/category/core-space-basics) and [papers](../../general/conflux-basics/additional-resources/papers.md). The unique concepts, such as [storage](../core-space-basics/storage.md), [base32 format addresses](../core-space-basics/addresses.md) and [sponsor mechanism](../core-space-basics/internal-contracts/sponsor-whitelist-control.md) are vital for Conflux users and developers.
- **Participate in Conflux's governance/community**. Learn how Conflux's governance works [here](../../general/conflux-basics/conflux-governance/governance-overview.md). You can also join the [Conflux forum](https://forum.conflux.fun/) and the <DiscordLink>Discord channel</DiscordLink> for more information.
- **Run a Conflux Node**. If you want to run a Conflux node and sync with the network, you can refer to [Run a Node](/docs/category/run-a-node) for more information.
- **Mine and Stake in Conflux**. If you want to mine CFX tokens and contribute to the security of the Conflux network, you can refer to [Mining & Staking](/docs/category/mining--staking) for more information.
- **Develop for Conflux**. If you want to develop your own smart contracts or DApps and deploy them on the Conflux network, you can explore our [developer tutorial](../core-developer-quickstart.md) or [tutorials](/docs/category/tutorials) to learn how to develop in Core Space step-by-step , or you also refer to [Build(Core Space)](/docs/category/build) for more documentation help. There are also [SDKs and tools](/docs/category/sdks-and-tools) to simplify your development process.
