## Introduction

As of mid-2024, the Conflux documentation reward system has changed. Only issues or pull requests that are explicitly listed as bounties in the documentation repository's issues are eligible for FansCoin (FC) rewards. Other contributions may not be rewarded.

## Bounty Reward Guidelines

- Bounties will be listed as issues in the [documentation repository's issues section](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-documentation/issues).
- Each bounty issue will specify the requirements and the FC reward amount.
- Only the first valid and accepted solution to a bounty will be eligible for the reward, unless otherwise stated in the issue.
- If your contribution is not associated with a listed bounty, it may not receive any reward.

## Reward Distribution Process

Rewards for completed bounties will be distributed according to the instructions in the relevant issue. Please follow the issue guidelines to claim your reward.

## Regular Evaluation of Reward Guidelines

The reward guidelines and bounty process may be updated periodically. Please refer to this document and the issues section for the latest information.

Thank you for your contributions to the Conflux documentation! If you have any questions, please open an issue in the repository.
