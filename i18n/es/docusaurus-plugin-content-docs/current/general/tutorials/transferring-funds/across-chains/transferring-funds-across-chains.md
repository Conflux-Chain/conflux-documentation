## Transferring Funds Across Chains Using ShuttleFlow

To transfer Funds to Conflux Core Space from other chains, users can do it on [ConfluxHub](https://www.confluxhub.io/shuttle-flow)â€™s ShuttleFlow page.

ShuttleFlow is a decentralized cross-chain asset transfer protocol that allows users to move their assets between different blockchain networks, such as Conflux Core, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. By using ShuttleFlow, users can transfer their assets quickly, securely, and at a low cost.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to transfer funds using ShuttleFlow:
