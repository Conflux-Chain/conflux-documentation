This wallet supports both Core and eSpace

:::

**Fluent**

Fluent is a web3 wallet built specifically for Conflux Network that enables users to interact with dApps and manage their assets securely and easily. With Fluent, users can easily manage their CFX and ERC-20 tokens, as well as interact with dApps on Conflux Network. It also provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for users looking to use Conflux Network and its ecosystem. The Fluent team is actively working to add new features and functionality to the wallet, making it an excellent choice for developers and users alike.

**Open Priority Connection**

In DApps, you can connect to Fluent by clicking "Connect MetaMask", provided that "Priority Connection" is turned on in Fluent's advanced options.


```mdx-code-block

import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';

<Image img={require('./img/fluent1.png')} style={{width: 300}}/>

```

```mdx-code-block

<Image img={require('./img/fluent2.png')} style={{width: 300}}/>

```


With "Priority Connection" enabled, Fluent will be the first option when connecting to any dApp using MetaMask.

**Show Testnet**

Considering that the testnet is for professional users, Fluent hides the testnet by default.

You can turn on "Show Testnet" in Fluent's advanced options.

```mdx-code-block

<Image img={require('./img/fluent3.png')} style={{width: 300}}/>

```
