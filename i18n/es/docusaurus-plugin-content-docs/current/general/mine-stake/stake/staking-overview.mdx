# PoS Staking Overview

This guide focuses on the practical aspects of staking CFX in Conflux's PoS mechanism. For technical details about how PoS works in Conflux, please refer to our [PoS Technical Overview](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/pos_overview).

## Benefits of Staking

By participating in PoS staking, you can:

- Earn rewards (current annual rate: **10%-14%**)
- Help secure the Conflux network
- Participate in network consensus

For detailed information about reward calculations, see the [Annual Return Rate Calculation Method](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/pos_overview#accrued-interest).

To understand why Conflux implements PoS alongside PoW, check [Why PoS](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/why-pos).

## Staking Lock-up Period

CFX staked into PoS has a lock-up period with the following specific rules:  

1. After staking CFX, there is a 13-day lock-up period during which the CFX status is **staking**.  
2. After 13 days, the CFX status changes to **staked**.  
3. If a user wants to retrieve their CFX, they must first perform an **unstake** operation, at which point the CFX status changes to **unstaking**, lasting for 1 day.  
4. After 1 day of the **unstaking** period, the CFX status changes to **unstaked**.  
5. At this point, the user can perform a **withdraw** operation, and the CFX will be returned to their Conflux account.  

For CFX that has not yet completed the lock-up period, an unstake operation can still be performed. However, in this case, the **unstaking** period will be extended to **14 days minus the number of days already staked**. 

For detailed examples and edge cases, see our [Staking Lock-up Examples](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/pos_overview#example).

## How to Participate in PoS

There are two main ways to participate in PoS staking:

### 1. Solo Staking

Run your own validator node with complete control over your staking operations. Best for technically proficient users with significant CFX holdings.

**Requirements:**

- Technical knowledge to run a node
- Minimum 1,000 CFX per vote, and higher for stable PoS rewards
- Ability to maintain 24/7 node operation

### 2. Stake Through a PoS Pool

Join a staking pool to participate without running your own node. Ideal for most users who want to stake without technical overhead.

**Benefits:**

- No technical knowledge required
- Lower minimum stake amount
- Professional node operation

For those interested in running a PoS Pool, see our [Pool Operator Guide](./running-staking-pool).

## Understanding Staking Risks

Before staking, it's important to understand the potential risks:

### 1. Force Retire

Occurs when a validator node is offline for extended periods. Results in:

- Automatic unstaking
- 24-hour penalty period
- No loss of principal

For detailed information about force retire causes and recovery, see [Penalties and Slashing](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/penalties_and_slash#force-retire).

### 2. Slashing

Severe penalty for malicious behavior, resulting in permanent loss of staked CFX. Learn more in our [Slashing Documentation](/docs/general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/penalties_and_slash#slashing).
