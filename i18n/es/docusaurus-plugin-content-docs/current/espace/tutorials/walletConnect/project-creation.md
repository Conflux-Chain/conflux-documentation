### Step 6: Use `ProjectId` in Your Dapp

- If you are building a Dapp on Conflux using the React.js framework, please refer to the following guide: [React.js WalletConnect Integration](/docs/espace/tutorials/walletConnect/reactjs)
- If you are using the Vue.js framework to develop a Dapp on Conflux, please consult this tutorial: [Vue.js WalletConnect Integration](/docs/espace/tutorials/walletConnect/vuejs)
- For those developing a Dapp on Conflux with the Next.js framework, please follow this link: [Next.js WalletConnect Integration](/docs/espace/tutorials/walletConnect/nextjs)

This guide helps developers set up a WalletConnect project and get a `ProjectId`, which is essential for integrating WalletConnect into dapps. Make sure your settings and configurations align with your application's needs to ensure a smooth user experience.
