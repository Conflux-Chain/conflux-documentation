Conflux introduces several built-in internal contracts for better system maintenance and on-chain governance. Now Conflux has seven internal contracts. These contracts provide [`solidity interfaces defined here`](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-rust/tree/master/internal_contract/contracts). These function can only be called via `CALL` or `STATICCALL` operation. Using operation `CALLCODE` or `DELEGATECALL` to interact with internal contracts will trigger an error.

`AdminControl` contract, `SponsorWhitelistControl` contract and `Staking` contract are introduced from the beginning.

`ConfluxContext`, `PoSRegister`, `ConfluxContext` are introduced at v2 hard-fork, 

`ParamsControl` is introduced at v2.1 hard-fork. 

The addresses of these 7 internal contracts are list as follows:
