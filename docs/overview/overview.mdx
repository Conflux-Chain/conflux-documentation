# Documentation Overview

Welcome to the Conflux Network Developer Portal! This comprehensive portal is designed to guide you through the complexities of the Conflux Network, a high-performance, decentralized blockchain network. Here, you'll find detailed summaries of the platform's foundational concepts, tools, and guidelines.

## **eSpace**

- [**User Guide**](../espace/UserGuide): A guide for users configuring Metamask to interact with Conflux's eSpace.

- [**Developer Quickstart**](../espace/DeveloperQuickstart): A quickstart for Ethereum developers to configure their development environment to interact with Conflux's eSpace.

- [**Developer Tutorials**](/docs/category/tutorials-1): Developer tutorials for building on Conflux's eSpace: Contracts deployment, verification.

- [**Cross Space Bridge**](../espace/build/cross-space-bridge): Learn about the cross space bridge, which enables seamless transfer of assets and data between Conflux's eSpace and Core Space.

- [**eSpace Network Endpoints**](../espace/network-endpoints): Find the list of network endpoints for eSpace.

- [**EVM Compatibility**](../espace/build/evm-compatibility): Learn about eSpace's VM compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), helping to deploy evm-compatible smart contracts and dapps to Conflux.

- [**JSON-RPC Compatibility**](../espace/build/jsonrpc-compatibility.md): Learn about eSpace's JSON-RPC compatibility with the Ethereum RPCs.

## **Core Space**

- [**Getting Started with Core Space**](../core/getting-started/):
Begin your journey in Conflux's Core space, understanding its fundamental concepts and operations.

- [**Developer Quickstart**](../core/core-developer-quickstart): A quickstart for developers to use `js-conflux-sdk` send their first Core Space transaction.

- [**Developer Tutorials**](/docs/category/tutorials): Developer tutorials for building on Core eSpace: Contracts deployment, contract verification, Sponsorship.

- [**Core Space Basics**](/docs/category/core-space-basics): Learn about the foundational concepts of Conflux's Core Space, including accounts, transactions, and gas.

- [**Core Space Network Endpoints**](../core/conflux_rpcs): Find the list of network endpoints for both Conflux's Core Space and eSpace.

- [**Core Space JSON-RPC**](../core/build/json-rpc/): Learn about the JSON-RPC protocols in the Core Space for remote procedures.

- [**Storage**](../core/core-space-basics/storage): Understand Conflux's Collateral for Storage (CFS) mechanism, the pricing method for using storage in Conflux **core space**, which is more fair and reasonable than Ethereum.

- [**Sponsorship Mechanism**](../core/core-space-basics/sponsor-mechanism):
Discover Conflux’s gas sponsorship mechanism, which facilitates smart contract usage without gas costs, allowing sponsored contract executions even by new, zero-balance accounts.

- [**Internal Contracts**](../core/core-space-basics/internal-contracts/):
Conflux introduces several built-in internal contracts for better system maintenance and on-chain governance in core space: `AdminControl`, `SponsorWhitelistControl`, `Staking`, `ConfluxContext`, `PoSRegister`, and `ParamsControl`. This section provides a comprehensive look at the internal contracts in Conflux that provide foundational functionality for the network here.

- [**Run a Node**](../general/run-a-node/):
Familiarize yourself with the process of setting up and operating a Conflux node, becoming an integral part of the network.

## **Understanding the Conflux Network**

- [**Spaces**](../general/conflux-basics/spaces):
Explore the dual space ecosystem of Conflux, facilitating seamless integration of Conflux-format and Ethereum-format transactions within one network.

- [**Consensus Mechanism**](../general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms): Discover Conflux's hybrid PoW-PoS consensus mechanism, combining Proof of Work with Proof of Stake for enhanced security and performance.

- [**TreeGraph & GHAST**](../general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-work/): The TreeGraph blockchain structure and GHAST algorithm are the foundational components of Conflux's Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.

- [**Proof Of Stake**](../general/conflux-basics/consensus-mechanisms/proof-of-stake/pos_overview): Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism that allows a blockchain network to achieve distributed consensus. Conflux's PoS mechanism is a hybrid PoW-PoS consensus mechanism, combining Proof of Work with Proof of Stake for enhanced security and performance.

- [**Economics**](../general/conflux-basics/economics): Introduction to the economic model of Conflux, including the native token, CFX, and its utility within the network.

- [**Governance**](../general/conflux-basics/conflux-governance/governance-overview): Conflux Governance Overview

- [**Research Papers**](../general/conflux-basics/additional-resources/conflux_papers): The Conflux Network is built on a foundation of rigorous research. Here, you'll find a collection of Conflux's research papers, including the original whitepaper, detailing the network's innovative consensus mechanism.

- [**Conflux_Protocol_Specification**](https://confluxnetwork.org/files/Conflux_Protocol_Specification.pdf): The yellow paper of Conflux.

- [**Accounts**](../general/conflux-basics/accounts):
Learn about network accounts, capable of holding balances and initiating transactions.

- [**Transactions**](../general/conflux-basics/transactions):
Explore the transactions – transfers and other actions that modify Conflux's state. Notably, this section also elucidates the unique aspects of the Conflux transaction lifecycle, distinct from Ethereum's model.

- [**Gas**](../general/conflux-basics/gas):
Learn about the gas mechanism in Conflux, which is utilized to compute transaction costs and incentivize network operations.
