# Deploying Upgradeable Contracts on Conflux eSpace using Hardhat

<!-- # Implementing Upgradeable Contracts: Basic Principles -->

Before diving into the tutorial, let's briefly explain the basic principles of implementing upgradeable contracts:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Contract logic is separated from storage using two contracts:

   - A Proxy contract that holds the state and receives user interactions.
   - A Logic contract (Implementation contract) that contains the actual code logic.

2. **Delegated Calls**: The Proxy contract uses `delegatecall` to forward function calls to the Logic contract.

3. **Upgradability**: Upgrade by deploying a new Logic contract and updating the Proxy to point to it.

4. **Fallback Function**: The Proxy contract uses a fallback function to catch and delegate all function calls.

5. **Storage Layout**: Ensure new versions of the Logic contract maintain the same storage layout to prevent data corruption.

The workflow of upgradeable contracts is as follows:

1. The Proxy contract stores the address of the current Logic contract.
2. When the Proxy is called, it triggers the fallback function.
3. The fallback function uses `delegatecall` to forward the call to the Logic contract.
4. The Logic contract executes the function in the context of the Proxy's storage.
5. To upgrade, deploy a new Logic contract and update the Proxy's reference.

This pattern allows for upgrading contract logic while preserving the contract's state and address, providing a seamless experience for users and other contracts interacting with the upgradeable contract.

Next, we'll proceed with the tutorial on how to implement this pattern on Conflux eSpace using Hardhat.

## 1. Project Setup

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, create a new directory and initialize the project:

```
mkdir upgradeable-contract-demo
cd upgradeable-contract-demo
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox dotenv
```

Next, initialize the Hardhat project and select the JavaScript default template:

```
npx hardhat
```

When prompted, choose "Create a JavaScript project". This will create a basic Hardhat project structure, including `contracts`, `scripts`, and `test` directories, as well as a default `hardhat.config.js` file.

After completing these steps, you'll have a basic Hardhat project structure using JavaScript, ready for writing and deploying upgradeable contracts.

## 2. Configure Hardhat

Create a Hardhat configuration file:

```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    eSpaceTestnet: {
      url: "https://evmtestnet.confluxrpc.com",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

Create a .env file and add your private key:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

## 3. Write Smart Contracts

Create a contracts directory and add the following contracts:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract SimpleUpgrade {
    // Address of the current implementation contract
    address public implementation;
    // Address of the admin who can upgrade the contract
    address public admin;
    // A string variable to demonstrate state changes
    string public words;

    // Constructor sets the initial implementation and admin
    constructor(address _implementation) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        implementation = _implementation;
    }

    // Fallback function to delegate calls to the implementation contract
    fallback() external payable {
        (bool success, ) = implementation.delegatecall(msg.data);
        require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
    }

    // Receive function to accept Ether
    receive() external payable {
    }

    // Function to upgrade the implementation contract
    // Only the admin can call this function
    function upgrade(address newImplementation) external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can upgrade");
        implementation = newImplementation;
    }
}
```

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;


contract Logic1 {
    // Address of the current implementation contract
    address public implementation;
    // Address of the admin who can upgrade the contract
    address public admin;
    // A string variable to demonstrate state changes
    string public words;

    // Function to set the 'words' variable
    function foo() public {
        words = "old";
    }
}
```

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract Logic2 {
    // Address of the current implementation contract
    address public implementation;
    // Address of the admin who can upgrade the contract
    address public admin;
    // A string variable to demonstrate state changes
    string public words;

    // Function to set the 'words' variable
    // Note: This function is different from Logic1
    function foo() public {
        words = "new";
    }
}
```

## 4. Deployment Script

Create a scripts directory and add the following script:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  // Deploy Logic1 contract
  const Logic1 = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Logic1");
  const logic1 = await Logic1.deploy();
  await logic1.waitForDeployment();
  console.log("Logic1 deployed to:", await logic1.getAddress());

  // Deploy SimpleUpgrade (Proxy) contract
  const SimpleUpgrade = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleUpgrade");
  const proxy = await SimpleUpgrade.deploy(await logic1.getAddress());
  await proxy.waitForDeployment();
  console.log("Proxy deployed to:", await proxy.getAddress());
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

## 5. Upgrade Script

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  // Address of the deployed proxy contract
  const proxyAddress = "YOUR_PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";

  // Deploy Logic2 contract
  const Logic2 = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Logic2");
  const logic2 = await Logic2.deploy();
  await logic2.waitForDeployment();
  console.log("Logic2 deployed to:", await logic2.getAddress());

  // Attach to the existing proxy contract
  const SimpleUpgrade = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleUpgrade");
  const proxy = SimpleUpgrade.attach(proxyAddress);

  // Log current contract information
  console.log("Admin address:", await proxy.admin());
  console.log("Current implementation:", await proxy.implementation());
  console.log("New implementation address:", await logic2.getAddress());

  // Get the signer (account that will send the transaction)
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Caller address:", await signer.getAddress());

  // Upgrade the proxy to point to the new implementation
  await proxy.upgrade(await logic2.getAddress(), {
    gasLimit: 1000000,
    maxFeePerGas: ethers.parseUnits("20", "gwei"),
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: ethers.parseUnits("2", "gwei"),
  });
  console.log("Proxy upgraded to Logic2");
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

## 6. Testing Before and After Upgrade

Create testBeforeUpgrade.js and testAfterUpgrade.js:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  // Address of the deployed proxy contract
  const proxyAddress = "YOUR_PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";

  // Attach to the proxy contract using Logic1 ABI
  const Logic1 = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Logic1");
  const proxy = Logic1.attach(proxyAddress);

  // Call the foo() function
  const tx = await proxy.foo();
  console.log("Waiting for on-chain confirmation...");
  await tx.wait();

  // Read the 'words' variable
  const words = await proxy.words();
  console.log("Words after calling Logic1's foo():", words);

  // Get the current implementation address
  const implementationAddress = await proxy.implementation();
  console.log("Current implementation address:", implementationAddress);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

The content of testAfterUpgrade.js is similar to testBeforeUpgrade.js, but you need to change Logic1 to Logic2 and expect the value of the words variable to be "new".

## 7. Deployment and Upgrade Process

1. Compile the contracts:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Deploy the initial contract:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network eSpaceTestnet
```

3. Run the pre-upgrade test:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/testBeforeUpgrade.js --network eSpaceTestnet
```

Expected output:

```
Words after calling Logic1's foo(): old
Current implementation address: 0x...(Logic1's address)
```

4. Upgrade the contract:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade.js --network eSpaceTestnet
```

5. Run the post-upgrade test:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/testAfterUpgrade.js --network eSpaceTestnet
```

Expected output:

```
Words after calling Logic2's foo(): new
Current implementation address: 0x...(Logic2's address)
```

By following this process, you can successfully deploy, test, and upgrade smart contracts on Conflux eSpace. This example demonstrates how to use a proxy contract to achieve upgradeability, allowing you to update contract logic without changing the contract address.
