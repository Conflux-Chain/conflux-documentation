Oracles are data feeds that enable smart contracts on the blockchain to access off-chain data sources. This functionality is crucial, as Ethereum-based smart contracts are inherently unable to access information stored outside the blockchain network by default. For further information, you can explore [Ethereum's Oracle documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/).

There are already oracle services available on Conflux eSpace.

## [Pyth](https://pyth.network/)

Pyth is a renowned oracle service in the industry, offering **Smarter Data for Smarter Contracts**. It ensures the security of your smart contracts by providing reliable, low-latency market data sourced from institutional-grade providers. Developers can build applications utilizing high-fidelity oracle feeds, specifically designed for mission-critical systems.

Pyth is already integrated in Conflux eSpace, you can use it directly. Check it's [documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/evm#mainnets) for how to use it in your smart contracts.

## [Witnet](https://witnet.io/)

Witnet is a permissionless, decentralized, and censorship-resistant oracle helping smart contracts to react to real world events with strong crypto-economic guarantees.
