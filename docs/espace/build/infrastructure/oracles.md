Oracles are data feeds that enable smart contracts on the blockchain to access off-chain data sources. This functionality is crucial, as Ethereum-based smart contracts are inherently unable to access information stored outside the blockchain network by default. For further information, you can explore [Ethereum's Oracle documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/oracles/).

There are already oracle services available on Conflux eSpace.
