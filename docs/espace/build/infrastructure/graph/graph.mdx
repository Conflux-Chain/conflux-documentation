[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) serves as a premier blockchain data indexing and querying solution for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chains. While Conflux eSpace is not directly supported by The Graph, its full EVM compatibility enables the use of The Graph on Conflux eSpace.

To utilize The Graph within Conflux eSpace, it's necessary to establish a The Graph node and subsequently create subgraphs. Comprehensive guides are available for [how to set up a The Graph node](./setup-graph-node.md) and [create subgraphs on Conflux eSpace](/docs/espace/tutorials/graph/create-subgraphs).

We also provide a self-hosted graph node cluster service named `Congraph`. For the community dAPP developers who want to use `Congraph` to index their subgraphs on Conflux eSpace (both Testnet and Mainnet are supported), please contact bd@confluxnetwork.org to send your request.
