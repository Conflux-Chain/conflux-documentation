[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) serves as a premier blockchain data indexing and querying solution for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chains. While Conflux eSpace is not directly supported by The Graph, its full EVM compatibility enables the use of The Graph on Conflux eSpace.

To use **The Graph** on Conflux eSpace. We need to set up a The Graph node and then create subgraphs. We provide a detail guide on [how to set up a The Graph node](./setup-graph-node.md) and [create subgraphs on Conflux eSpace](./create-subgraphs.md).
