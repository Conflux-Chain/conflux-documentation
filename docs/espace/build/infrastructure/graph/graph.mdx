[**The Graph**](https://thegraph.com/) is a leading **blockchain data index and query solution** for EVM chains. Currently Conflux eSpace is not directly supported by it, but we are fully EVM compatible, so it can also be used on Conflux eSpace. 

To use **The Graph** on Conflux eSpace. We need to set up a The Graph node and then create subgraphs. We provide a detail guide on [how to set up a The Graph node](./setup-graph-node.md) and [create subgraphs on Conflux eSpace](./create-subgraphs.md).
