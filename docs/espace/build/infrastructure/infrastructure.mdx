Web3 dApps's development is a complex process that requires a lot of different tools and services. Currently, there are a lot of different solutions on eSpace that can be used to build a dApp:

- [RPC Service Providers](./RPC-Provider): Enterpise-grade RPC service providers that provide access to the blockchain network.
- [TheGraph](./graph): TheGraph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains.
- [Oracles](./oracles): Oracles are data feeds that make off-chain data sources available to the blockchain for smart contracts.
