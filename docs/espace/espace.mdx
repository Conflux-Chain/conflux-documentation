Conflux eSpace is a fully **EVM-compatible** space(or chain) of Conflux with much lower gas fee and higher TPS than Ethereum, it is independent from [Core](../core/core.mdx) space.

The experience of eSpace for **developers** and **common users** is the same as Ethereum. dApps of Ethereum can be directly deployed to eSpace without any modification. 
Development tools(Remix, Hardhat, Foundry etc), SDKs(ethers.js, viem, web3.py), wallets(Metamask, Taho), and services(TheGraph) of Ethereum can be directly used in eSpace.

- `Developer Quickstart`: introduces how to configure main stream Ethereum development environment on eSpace.
- `Tutorials`: introduces how to build on eSpace.
- `Build`: introduces technical details of eSpace.
