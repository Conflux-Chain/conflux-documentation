title: Transfer Funds Across Chains Using Multichain
---

:::note Note to Binance users and bCFX holders: Conflux on Binance is listed as wrapped ERC-20 token (bCFX), it is not native CFX. Conflux eSpace and BNB Chain use EVM-compatible addresses, but those addresses live in different chains.
:::

[Multichain](https://conflux.multichain.org/#/router) is a cross-chain bridge that supports multiple networks. With Multichain, you can bridge different tokens across different networks into Conflux eSpace, or from Conflux eSpace to other networks.
In this guide, we'll bridge bCFX from BNB Chain to Conflux eSpace through Multichain.

## Prerequisites
- A BNB Chain account funded with bCFX and BNB.
- For the purposes of this guide, we'll bridge bCFX from BNB Chain to Conflux eSpace. However, other chains and tokens are also supported.
- Your MetaMask wallet connected to Conflux eSpace.
