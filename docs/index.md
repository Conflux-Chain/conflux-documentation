# CONFLUX DOCUMENTATION INDEX

Welcome to the Conflux Network Documentation Portal. Here, you'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with Conflux Network as quickly as possible. This page is designed to help you navigate through the documentation and resources in this website. Dive into the sections below to explore more:

## **1. [General](general)**

The “General” section includes all the foundational concepts and topics that apply for both Core and eSpace.

- [**Conflux Basics**](general/conflux-basics): Introducing the basic concept and design of Conflux network.

- [**Run a Node**](general/run-a-node): Introducing how to run a node for Conflux network.

- [**Hard Forks**](general/hardforks): This section itemizes the hard forks of Conflux and provides a description of the associated modifications.

- [**Mining & Staking**](category/mining--staking): Providing tutorials for mining/staking in Conflux.
    
- [**Build**](general/build): Documents for Conflux node developer (Not for dApp developer).
    
- [**FAQ**](general/faq): Most frequently asked questions for all of Conflux network.
    
- [**Contributing**](general/CONTRIBUTING): Learn how to contribute on improving this documentation portal.

## **2. [Core](core)**

Conflux Core Space is a native space that supports contract sponsorship and boasts a higher TPS (Transactions Per Second). This section provides insights for both Conflux Core Space users and developers.

- [**Learn**](core/learn): Introduces concepts and mechanisms for Conflux core space.
    
- [**Build**](core/build): Introduces how to build dApps in Conflux core space.
    

## **3. [eSpace](espace)**

Conflux eSpace is a logically independent space that operates on the same foundational infrastructure as the Core space. It offers a fully compatible interface with Ethereum Virtual Machine, enabling EVM based dApps to be directly deployed to eSpace without any modifications. Moreover, Ethereum's development tools, SDKs, wallets, and services can be seamlessly used in eSpace.

- [**Learn**](espace/learn): User guide of eSpace.
    
- [**Build**](espace/build): Introduces how to develop in eSpace.
