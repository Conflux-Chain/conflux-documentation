Welcome to Conflux documentation contributing guide! This page serves as an index and introduction to the various contribution guidelines and reward systems we have in place to recognize and encourage community involvement.

## How to Contribute

This section outlines the various ways you can contribute to our documentation site. Whether it's by pointing out a mistake, providing translations, creating visual aids, suggesting improvements, or writing content, every contribution is valuable. We provide detailed steps on how to report issues, submit changes, and help with translations to ensure a smooth and rewarding experience for our contributors.

## Reward Guidelines

Our Contribution Reward Guidelines are designed to acknowledge the efforts of our community members. As of now, only issues or pull requests that are explicitly listed as bounties in the documentation repository's issues are eligible for FansCoin (FC) rewards. Rewards are primarily focused on these designated bounties. Please refer to the reward guidelines for more details.
