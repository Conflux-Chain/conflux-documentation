## Introduction

Welcome to the Conflux Contribution Reward Guidelines. Our mission is to build a robust, accessible, and community-driven platform, and your contributions are integral to achieving this vision. Whether you are an experienced developer, a technical writer, a first-time contributor, or simply an enthusiast, your insights, ideas, and improvements can make a significant impact. Understanding that every effort put toward enhancing the Conflux environment deserves recognition, we've implemented a reward system based on FansCoin (FC).

This article details how your contributions, categorized under 'Issues' and 'Pull Requests', are rewarded. You will learn how identifying problems or presenting enhancements in various aspects—ranging from formatting and readability to error identification—is rewarded. With your support, Conflux continues to evolve and improve by the day.

### Pull Requests (16 ~ 640 FC and much more)

Most of the times, pull requests rewards is determined by the content and complexity. Please refer to [rewards evaluation](#rewards-evaluation-and-examples) to see how the value will be determined.

* It's desirable to always raise an issue prior to creating a pull request. If the pull request fully resolves an issue, the reward is at least equivalent to that of the issue, regardless of the effort involved.
* If the originator of the pull request solves an issue they raised, they receive an extra 25% reward.
* Examples include :
  * **Formatting**
    * Fixing spelling or grammar errors: 16 FC.
    * Updating broken links or outdated information: 16 FC.
    * Resolving issues with code blocks or other formatting: 32 FC.
    * Rectifying issues with images, diagrams: 64 FC.
  * **Improvements**
    * Providing better conceptual explanations: From 30 FC, up to 100 FC or more, determined by content and significance.
    * Proposing optimized descriptions for a problem: From 30 FC, up to 100 FC or more, determined by importance.
    * Adding explanations about specific feature use-cases: From 128 FC, up to 300 FC or more, determined by content and significance.
    * Providing added context to enhance understanding: From 128 FC, up to 300 FC or more, determined by content and significance.

#### Rewards Evaluation and Examples

As the rewards for pull requests are mostly determined case-by-case, we would like to let contributors know how rewards are evaluated.

* Importance of the created contents. Here are contents we consider of higher significance
  * Conflux-specific contents
  * Contents developers are more likely to visit
  * Code/project examples ready to use out of the box
* Complexity and efforts made on the pull request
  * More hours needed to complete the work (evaluated via content quality)
  * (Runnable) code attached
  * Higher techinical skill threshold
  * Visual aids attached

Several examples would be provided for reference:

| Pull Request | Guideline <br/> Floor Reward| Expected Reward | Content|  Why |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[PR#494](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-documentation/pull/494)|80| 300*125% |New article regarding reentrancy Attack|+ important content (frequent security issue) <br/> + with code <br/> + resolving creator issue <br/> + new article stating clearly for the topc|

:::note

The `Expected Reward` serves as the evaluation of the FC to receive according to the **latest** reward guideline. However, as the creator might be our internal contributor or contribution guideline is changed, the actual reward distribution amount may vary.

## How Rewards are Distributed

We are tracking rewards with an internal table and results will be periodically revealed in [Github discussions](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/conflux-documentation/discussions).

## Regular Review of Reward Guidelines

Please note that the reward guidelines are subject to review and possible changes every 3 months. This ensures that our guidelines remain relevant and effective in promoting and rewarding valuable contributions.

We look forward to your contributions and thank you for helping us improve our documentation site! If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to create an issue in our Github repo.
