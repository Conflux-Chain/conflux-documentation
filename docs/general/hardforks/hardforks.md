# Hard Forks

A hard fork represents a significant alteration in a blockchain network's protocol. Such a change is not backward compatible, implying that every network participant must upgrade their software to the latest version to remain an active participant within the network.

It's helpful to visualize a hard fork as a split in the blockchain's course. Prior to the hard fork, all participants traveled along the same trajectory. However, following the hard fork, this single path divides into two distinct paths. One continues under the old rules, while the other adheres to the newly implemented rules.

## Scheduled Hard Forks

Scheduled hard forks, which are preplanned and agreed upon by the community in advance, represent a specific type of hard fork. They are usually implemented to introduce new features or enhancements to the blockchain system. For example, a scheduled hard fork might be executed to enlarge the block size limit, integrate novel features like token-burning mechanisms, or rectify existing bugs.

Upon the execution of a scheduled hard fork, all network participants are expected to update their nodes to the newest version. Failure to do so will render them incapable of participating in the validation and verification of new transactions on the blockchain.

Given that these hard forks are preapproved by the community, the old blockchain typically ceases to exist. All members upgrade their systems, and the outdated version becomes obsolete.
