# **Conflux Ecosystem Grants Overview**

## **Introduction**

Conflux Network operates two distinct grant streams: Technical and Growth grants. Each stream has specific mandates and application requirements. Applications for both streams are submitted via the Conflux [forum](https://forum.conflux.fun/).

### **Grant Streams**

1. **Technical Grants**: Focus on enhancing the Conflux technology stack, including developer tooling and infrastructure, and increasing the number of developers and projects on Conflux.
2. **Growth Grants**: Aim to increase user interaction with Conflux by supporting projects deployed on Conflux eSpace. This includes user incentivization, community and marketing efforts, and ecosystem partnerships.

## **Application Process**

1. **Choose Grants Stream**: Select the appropriate grant stream and review all materials.
2. **Submit Application to Forum**: Complete the grant application form and submit it to the forum.
3. **Evaluation**: The Grants Committee reviews all completed applications on a rolling basis.
4. **Decision**: Grants meeting the approval criteria are awarded.

## **Funding Tiers**

- **Tier 1**: Up to $5k for projects under 1 month. Requires 2 votes.
- **Tier 2**: Up to $15k for projects under 3 months. Requires 3 votes.
- **Tier 3**: Up to $50k for projects under 6 months. Requires 3 votes and Conflux Foundation sign-off.

## **Grant Onboarding**

Successful applicants are assigned a “Grant Shepherd” who guides them through the grant process, including:

## **Grant Program Terms of Use**

All grant applicants must agree to the No Sale Rule and Public Reporting Requirements:

These templates are designed to guide applicants through the necessary information and requirements, ensuring that all relevant details are covered for the Grants Committee to evaluate the applications effectively.
