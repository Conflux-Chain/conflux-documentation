## Introduction to Smart Contracts on Conflux Network

Smart contracts are an essential component of the Conflux Network, offering a powerful way to automate and execute code on the blockchain. These self-executing contracts consist of code that automatically implements the terms of an agreement based on predefined rules. This introduction will explore the key concepts, functionalities, and potential applications of smart contracts within the Conflux ecosystem.

### Definition and Overview
Smart contracts on Conflux are programs stored on the blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They are immutable and distributed, meaning once deployed, they cannot be altered and are executed by the network.

### How Smart Contracts Work
These contracts are written in high-level programming languages like Solidity, similar to Ethereum. They interact with the blockchain to store, modify data, or send transactions, automating complex processes without intermediaries.

### Benefits in the Conflux Network
Smart contracts in Conflux offer benefits like enhanced security, reduced transaction costs, and increased efficiency. Conflux's unique tree-graph structure facilitates higher throughput and lower fees, making it an ideal platform for deploying smart contracts.

### Use Cases
The applications are diverse, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) and token creation to supply chain management and gaming. Smart contracts serve as the backbone for DApps (Decentralized Applications) on Conflux, enabling innovative business models and services.

### Security Considerations
Security in smart contracts is paramount. Despite their immutability, vulnerabilities in code can be exploited. Conflux Network emphasizes best practices in smart contract development, including thorough testing and audits.

### Getting Started with Smart Contracts on Conflux
Developers can start by learning [**Solidity**](solidity-basics.md), understanding Conflux's unique features, and using tools like Conflux Studio for development and testing.
