# Payable Admin Functions for Gas Optimization

Admin functions can be payable to save gas. Making admin-specific functions payable reduces gas costs because the compiler won't check the callvalue of the function. This approach also makes the contract smaller and cheaper to deploy as there will be fewer opcodes in the creation and runtime code.

Below is an example demonstrating how to implement payable admin functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AdminPayable {

    address public admin;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function adminFunction() external payable onlyAdmin {
        // Admin specific logic here
    }

    function withdraw() external onlyAdmin {
        payable(admin).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `adminFunction` is payable, which can help save gas costs. The admin can also withdraw funds from the contract using the `withdraw` function.

Recommendations for gas optimization:

ðŸŒŸ Consider making admin functions payable to reduce gas costs associated with value checks by the compiler.

ðŸŒŸ Ensure proper access controls are in place to restrict payable functions to authorized addresses only.
