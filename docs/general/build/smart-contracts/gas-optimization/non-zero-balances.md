# Avoid Zero to One Writes and Maintain Non-Zero Balances

This guide delves into specific gas optimization techniques to manage ERC20 token balances and storage variables effectively in Solidity, particularly emphasizing the need to avoid zero to one writes.

## Avoiding Zero to One Storage Writes

**Why It Matters**: Initializing a storage variable from zero to non-zero is one of the most gas-intensive operations a contract can perform. It requires 22,100 gas in total, which includes 20,000 gas for changing the value from zero to non-zero and 2,100 gas for cold storage access.

**OpenZeppelin's Approach**: OpenZeppelin utilizes values of 1 and 2 to indicate inactive and active states, respectively, rather than 0 and 1. This practice reduces the cost significantly, as changing between non-zero values costs only 5,000 gas.

**DemoCode**

Below, we provide an improved contract implementation to manage balance updates efficiently:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract BalanceManagement {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Initialize with non-zero to avoid expensive zero to one write
    constructor() {
        balances[msg.sender] = 1; // Starts with 1 instead of 0
    }

    // Increment balance safely
    function incrementBalance(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    // Decrement balance, avoiding going to zero
    function decrementBalance(uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > amount, "Insufficient funds to decrement");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        if (balances[msg.sender] == 0) {
            balances[msg.sender] = 1; // Reset to 1 to avoid zero balance
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Recommendations for Gas Optimization:

1. **Prevent Zero Balances**: Ensure that token balances do not drop to zero. Implement logic to reset the balance to a small positive value if it ever reaches zero.
2. **Optimize Storage Initialization**: Start storage variables at a non-zero value to avoid costly initializations and manage subsequent updates carefully to keep modifications within non-zero values.

Understanding these optimization techniques and integrating them effectively can help reduce transaction costs and improve the efficiency of your smart contracts.
