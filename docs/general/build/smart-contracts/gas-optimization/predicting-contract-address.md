# Gas Optimization Through Predictive Contract Address Calculation in Solidity

In Solidity, predicting contract addresses before their deployment can save significant amounts of gas, especially when deploying interdependent contracts. This method eliminates the need for setter functions and storage variables, which are costly in terms of gas usage. We will use the `LibRLP` library from Solady to deterministically compute the addresses based on the deployer's nonce.

## Background

In scenarios where two contracts are interdependent, like a `DataStorage` contract and a `DataWriter` contract, managing their addresses effectively is crucial. Typically, after deploying both contracts, you would set the address of one contract in the other using a setter function. However, this approach involves multiple transactions and storage operations, which are expensive.

## Optimized Implementation Using LibRLP

Instead of using setter functions, we can compute the address of each contract before deployment and pass these addresses to the constructors, significantly reducing gas costs.

Below is the optimized code, demonstrating this technique:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import {LibRLP} from "https://github.com/vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/LibRLP.sol";

contract DataStorage {
    address immutable public dataWriter;
    uint256 public value;

    constructor(address _dataWriter) {
        dataWriter = _dataWriter;
    }

    // cost: 47158 gas
    function storeValue(uint256 newValue) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(dataWriter), "Only DataWriter can update value");
        value = newValue;
    }
}

contract DataWriter {
    DataStorage immutable public dataStorage;

    constructor(DataStorage _dataStorage) {
        dataStorage = _dataStorage;
    }

    function writeValue(uint256 newValue) external {
        dataStorage.storeValue(newValue);
    }
}

contract DeploymentManager {
    using LibRLP for address;

    function deployContracts() public returns(DataStorage dataStorage, address dataWriter) {
        DataStorage precomputedDataStorage = DataStorage(address(this).computeAddress(2));
        dataWriter = address(new DataWriter(precomputedDataStorage));
        dataStorage = new DataStorage(dataWriter);

        require(dataStorage == precomputedDataStorage, "Computed address mismatch");
    }
}
```

## Gas Savings

By precomputing the addresses and using immutable storage for contract references, we have reduced the gas cost of `writeValue()` from 49k to 47k, saving over 2k gas per call.

## Conclusion

This method not only reduces gas consumption but also simplifies the deployment process by removing the need for post-deployment setup calls. Such techniques are essential for optimizing contract interactions on blockchains where gas costs can significantly impact the usability and feasibility of smart contracts.
