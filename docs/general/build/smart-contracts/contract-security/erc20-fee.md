# ERC20: Fee on Transfer

When dealing with untrusted tokens, you shouldnâ€™t assume that your balance necessarily increases by the amount you transfer. It is possible for an ERC20 token to implement its transfer function to include a fee, which can lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.

Consider the following example where an ERC20 token applies a 1% tax to every transaction:git

```solidity
contract ERC20 {
    // internally called by transfer() and transferFrom()
    // balance and approval checks happen in the caller
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {
        uint256 fee = amount * 100 / 99;
        balanceOf[from] -= to;
        balanceOf[to] += (amount - fee);
        balanceOf[TREASURY] += fee;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, (amount - fee));
        return true;
    }
}
```

This token applies a 1% tax to every transaction. If a smart contract interacts with the token without accounting for this fee, it can result in unexpected reverts or stolen funds.

#### Vulnerable Contract Example

Here is an example of a staking contract that does not account for the fee on transfer:

```solidity
contract Stake {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balancesInContract;

    function stake(uint256 amount) public {
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        balancesInContract[msg.sender] += amount; // THIS IS WRONG!
    }

    function unstake() public {
        uint256 toSend = balancesInContract[msg.sender];
        delete balancesInContract[msg.sender];
        // This could revert because toSend is 1% greater than
        // the amount in the contract. Otherwise, 1% will be "stolen"
        // from other depositors.
        token.transfer(msg.sender, toSend);
    }
}
```

### Prevention Techniques

To secure smart contracts interacting with fee-on-transfer tokens, consider the following approaches:

1. **Accurately Track Transferred Amounts**: Always check the actual amount received or sent during transfers.
2. **Use Safe Transfer Functions**: Utilize functions that can handle fee deductions internally and adjust balances accordingly.

#### Secure Contract Example

Here is a corrected version of the staking contract:

```solidity
contract SecureStake {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balancesInContract;

    function stake(uint256 amount) public {
        uint256 initialBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 finalBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 actualReceived = finalBalance - initialBalance;
        balancesInContract[msg.sender] += actualReceived;
    }

    function unstake() public {
        uint256 toSend = balancesInContract[msg.sender];
        delete balancesInContract[msg.sender];
        uint256 initialBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        token.transfer(msg.sender, toSend);
        uint256 finalBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 actualSent = initialBalance - finalBalance;
        require(actualSent <= toSend, "Fee on transfer too high");
    }
}
```

By tracking the actual amounts transferred and received, the contract ensures that it correctly handles tokens with transfer fees, preventing unexpected reverts and safeguarding user funds.

### Conclusion

Handling ERC20 tokens with transfer fees requires careful consideration to ensure accurate balance tracking and prevent unexpected errors. Always verify the actual transferred amounts and implement safeguards to handle potential fees correctly.
