### Provide Translation

We are using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/conflux) for document translation integration. Translation strings will be pushed to Github repo after they are reviewed. A translation PR in the Github repo will NEVER be accepted.

## Contributor POAPs

Anyone who contributes to the documentation site during a season can mint a contributor POAP. Your contribution must be accepted or implemented to be eligible for the POAP.

### Special POAPs

In addition to the regular contributor POAPs, we recognize and reward significant contributions with special POAPs. Examples of significant contributions include high-quality guides or consistent, frequent contributions to the project. The decision to award a special POAP is made on a case-by-case basis by the project maintainers.

### Issuing Rule Updates

Please note that the POAP issuing rules are subject to review and possible changes every 3 months. This ensures that our guidelines remain relevant and effective in promoting and rewarding valuable contributions.

We look forward to your contributions and thank you for helping us improve our documentation site! If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to create an issue in our Github repo.
