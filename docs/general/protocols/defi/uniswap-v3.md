# Uniswap V3

## Introduction

Uniswap V3, launched in May 2021, represents a significant evolution in automated market maker (AMM) technology. This version introduces groundbreaking features that dramatically improve capital efficiency and provide liquidity providers with more control over their positions. It maintains the core principles of permissionless trading while offering enhanced functionality compared to its predecessors.

## Key Features and Improvements

### 1. Concentrated Liquidity

The most significant innovation in V3 is concentrated liquidity, allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to specify custom price ranges for their positions. This feature enables:
- Up to 4000x capital efficiency compared to V2
- Better execution prices for traders
- More granular control over LP positions

### 2. Multiple Fee Tiers

Uniswap V3 introduces multiple fee tiers per pair:
- 0.01% for stable pairs
- 0.05% for stable-like pairs
- 0.30% for standard pairs
- 1.00% for exotic pairs

### 3. Non-Fungible Liquidity

Unlike V2's fungible LP tokens, V3 positions are represented as NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) because:
- Each position can have unique parameters
- Positions are non-fungible due to custom price ranges
- Enhanced position management capabilities

### 4. Advanced Oracle System

V3 features an improved oracle system that:
- Provides higher precision price data
- Offers better manipulation resistance
- Allows access to recent price observations

### 5. Range Orders

Introduces the concept of range orders, allowing users to:
- Create limit order-like positions
- Automatically execute trades at specific price points
- Implement more sophisticated trading strategies

## How Uniswap V3 Works

### Concentrated Liquidity Mechanism

1. **Position Creation**: LPs select a price range where their liquidity will be active.
2. **Active Range**: Liquidity only participates in trades when the current price is within the selected range.
3. **Capital Efficiency**: Concentrated positions earn higher fees within their range but nothing outside it.
4. **Position Management**: LPs can adjust ranges or add/remove liquidity as needed.

### Price Range Mechanics

1. **Tick System**: Prices are organized into "ticks" representing discrete price points.
2. **Range Selection**: LPs choose upper and lower tick boundaries for their positions.
3. **Fee Accumulation**: Fees are earned proportional to provided liquidity within active ranges.
