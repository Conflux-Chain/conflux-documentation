# Transfer Assets Across Chains Using Zero Gravity

One of the easiest ways to transfer assets between Core Space and other chains is through the use of [Zero Gravity](https://portal.zglabs.org/).
To get started, we recommend setting up two wallets: Fluent for Core Space and MetaMask for the other chain of your choice. 
In this tutorial, we will explain the steps to transfer CFX from Conflux Core Space to BNB Smart Chain.

## Prerequisites for this tutorial

- A Fluent Wallet funded with at least 200 CFX.
- A MetaMask Wallet.

## Transferring CFX from Conflux Core to BNB Smart Chain
