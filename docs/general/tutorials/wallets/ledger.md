*Note: If you do not have CFX, you can purchase at one of the exchanges listed [here](../transferring-funds/from-exchanges).*

1. Make sure you have already imported your Ledger account into your MetaMask wallet by following the steps in the previous section. Quit Ledger Live if it is currently opened.

#### Receiving Crypto Assets

In order to receive CFX and ERC20 tokens to your Ledger wallet account, simply copy your address from MetaMask and share it with the sender. You only need to sign transactions using your Ledger device when sending funds, not when receiving them. MetaMask can also provide you with an easy-to-use QR code under "Account details".

#### Obtaining CFX

There are multiple ways of obtaining CFX and other tokens on Conflux eSpace.

- You can obtain CFX and withdraw it to Conflux eSpace through a variety of centralized exchanges (e.g., [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com)).
- You can also use a decentralized exchange like [Swappi](https://app.swappi.io/#/swap).
- Finally, you can also transfer crypto assets from other chains to Conflux eSpace through cross-chain apps like [Multichain](https://app.multichain.org/#/router), [meson.fi](https://meson.fi/), [cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer), or the [Conflux eSpace Bridge](https://confluxhub.io/espace-bridge).


#### Checking Your Balance

The easiest way to check your CFX and ERC20 token balances held by your Ledger account is to simply view them in MetaMask.
