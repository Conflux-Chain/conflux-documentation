## **A Scalable Economic Model**

Conflux's economic model incorporates incentivizing mechanisms designed to encourage healthy participation and growth of the network. The system is designed to ensure that economic participation in the network supports the technological stability of Conflux. This economic model is a key element of Conflux's smart contract ecosystem, as well as the network's ability to process 3,000-6,000 transactions per second.

As the only regulatory-compliant, public, and permissionless blockchain in China, Conflux's economic model also promotes the network's functionality as an economic and technological bridge for individuals and crypto projects interested in entering China on a global scale.

To ensure the efficient operation of a decentralized system, a high-performance technology is required. A well-designed economic model is also indispensable to ensure that all participants within the ecosystem can obtain their incentives through cooperation and division of labor. Blockchain technology establishes trust, encourages more efficient relationships among cooperators, and accelerates the transfer of value.

## Core Factors of an Economic Model

**1. Value System:** Public blockchain systems require a basic value carrier (tokens) as a measurable unit with economic value. Tokens serve as a transaction medium for value interaction in the blockchain network, allowing users to clarify their asset ownership. Many blockchain protocols pre-mine a specific amount of tokens in the genesis block, offering them as a reward for miners who maintain the security and smooth operation of the blockchain system. Ideally, tokens can also be connected to storage resources and distributed to different participants as long-term incentives.

**2. Governance Rules:** Governance rules involve the distribution and use of tokens, as well as their economic impact under different conditions. When certain rules are met, tokens can be distributed to some users as interest or to miners as block rewards. Tokens can also be exchanged into fiat currencies in the offline world or other digital currencies at certain exchange rates, all of which are affected by the issuance of the token.

**3. Community Collaboration:** For blockchain systems, it is essential to be "open to everyone and beneficial to all participants." All users in the ecosystem have the right to enter the system without barriers. In a distributed business model, everyone can become a shareholder, contribute to the construction of the system, and benefit from their efforts.

As a Turing complete PoW blockchain system, Conflux Network greatly improves the performance of the underlying network using the innovative Tree-Graph consensus algorithm, reducing transaction confirmation time and thus increases transaction throughput.

Our trial results showed that the Conflux Network based on the Tree-Graph consensus algorithm transfers over 3,000 transactions per second, displaying a much higher performance than Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the current technical indicators, the Conflux Network runs at a fixed speed of generating two blocks per second. In total, the number of blocks generated per day is approximately 60 × 60 × 24 × 2 = 172,800.

In addition, to solve the problem of congestion, Conflux Network allows users to deposit tokens for storage space. The cost of the storage space effectively reduces unnecessary storage resources. Meanwhile, Conflux Network will offer extra interest for providing storage space. This is a sustainable income for miners.

## **The Concept of Conflux Economic Model**

In order to further increase the value of Conflux Network and provide users with proper economic incentives and more value-added services, Conflux Network will provide all participants incentives to participate in the network through an economically driven model, and ensure that all users can access the ecosystem without barriers, while keeping the ecosystem safe, stable and predictable.

The pre-mined token of Conflux Network is called CFX. Each CFX contains 10¹⁸ drips (the smallest unit of CFX). As a non-profit organization, the Conflux Foundation’s main task is to offer incentives for the builders and maintainers involved in the ecosystem during the kick-off (cold-start) phase, and to ensure that all resources are distributed as balanced as possible.

At the beginning, the amount of pre-mined tokens in the genesis block of Conflux is 5 billion CFX, which will be unlocked gradually as Conflux Network launches.

## **The Incentive Model of Conflux Economic Model**

Participants in the Conflux Network ecosystem include three groups:

1) ***Direct builders**:* *Conflux Foundation* and the *founding team* responsible for developing the underlying technology of the Conflux public chain and the Conflux Network operations;

2) ***System maintainers***: *Miners* maintaining the normal operation and security of the whole Conflux Network system;

3) ***Ecosystem contributors***: *Community Users* who continuously generate value for the Conflux Network ecosystem.

From the perspective of the above-mentioned participants, Conflux Network will choose different incentive patterns during different development phases to ensure a stable shift from the initial phase to the operational phase.

**Initial phase**: the *direct builders* and the *ecosystem contributors* are incentivized to resolve the cold start problem of the system;

**Operational phase**: *system maintainers* are incentivized to promote continuous system upgrading; self-adaptive configuration of Conflux system resources is promoted through the marketization of system resources.

In the previous section we described that the amount of pre-mined tokens in the genesis block of Conflux Network is 5 billion CFX. The pre-mined tokens will be offered as rewards to the *direct builders* and the *ecosystem contributors* of Conflux Network.

*Direct builders* are rewarded to constantly improve the ecosystem and to lay a solid foundation for the entire Conflux ecosystem.

**Private Equity Funders**: 16% of the genesis tokens will be allocated to our private round investors and will be released over two years.

**Genesis Team**: 36% of the genesis tokens will be awarded to the founding team including the IIIS team (of Tsinghua University), Conflux Foundation employees, and advisors. The genesis team’s tokens will be released over 4 years and serve as a capital pool.

Reasonable marketing activities will be set to solve the cold start problem so that users joining the ecosystem in an early stage and early miners will get extra tokens or higher block-rewards. This will encourage them to contribute more to the ecosystem.

**Community Fund:** 8% of the genesis tokens will be provided as rewards for ordinary community users for the encouragement of them to participate in the early stages of developing and maintaining the Conflux ecosystem. This part of the tokens will be unlocked within four years.

**Ecosystem Fund**: 40% of the genesis tokens will be offered to community developers supporting the DApps in the Conflux ecosystem. This proportion of tokens will be unlocked within four years.

**Public Fund**: 0% of the genesis tokens will be allocated into the public fund account.

In the initial phase, direct builders and ecosystem contributors are rewarded to constantly improve the ecosystem and lay a solid foundation for the entire ecosystem during the cold start phase.

In the operational phase, system maintainers are inspired to promote continuous system upgrading; ecosystem contributors are encouraged to constantly generate value for the ecosystem. Meanwhile, self-adaptive configuration of Conflux system resources is promoted through system resource marketization.

Miners, the major maintainers of the Proof of Work (PoW) system, are mainly responsible for confirming transactions recorded in the system. They are important roles for the stability of the system. Incentives are the main source of miner incomes, so the design of the miner incentive model directly affects the sustainability of the system.

## **The Core of Conflux’s Economic Model: The CFX Token**

To understand how these factors operate within Conflux’s economic model, we need to take a look at the core of Conflux’s value system: **Conflux’s native token, CFX.**

Each CFX token consists of smaller units called **drips**, which are similar to Gwei on the Ethereum network or Satoshis on Bitcoin. To send a transaction on the Conflux Network, a small amount of drip is paid as a transaction fee. These fees are awarded to system maintainers (miners).

The Conflux Network incorporates a certain level of built-in inflation: more CFX is gradually added to the total circulation over time. Today, there are more than 800M CFX in circulation, which is a mix of both the pre-mine distribution and the new mining and staking rewards being generated.

## **Liquid vs. Staked CFX Tokens**

Each CFX token exists on the Conflux Network in one of two forms: tokens are either **liquid** or **staked**. If tokens are **liquid**, they can be transferred and used freely. If a token is **staked**, it cannot be freely transferred, until it is no longer staked.

## **CFX tokens are staked if:**

1. They have been intentionally [staked](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-staking) in the Conflux Network, thus earning interest payments for the holder through staking rewards;
2. They have been locked into the Conflux Network for a fixed period of time to purchase votes in Conflux Network governance;
3. They have been placed into bonded storage to purchase space on the network. (This is necessary to keep smart contracts and data stored on-chain active on Conflux.)

## **Economic Incentive Mechanisms on the Conflux Network**

Each mechanism has been designed to encourage users to participate in the network. Their collective goal is to ensure that Conflux is safe, reliable, and stable, and can be accessed with minimal barriers to entry. These incentivizing mechanisms also contribute to the proper usage of Conflux’s computing and on-chain storage resources.

During the initial stages of Conflux’s development, the economic model was designed to reward [**direct builders**](https://medium.com/conflux-network/conflux-networks-economic-model-pre-mined-token-distribution-and-proportions-f92fe00696ea) of the network. These include the Conflux Foundation and Conflux’s founding team.

Now that the network is fully operational, its incentivizing mechanisms are primarily designed to reward **system maintainers** and **ecosystem contributors.** System maintainers are miners who ensure the secure operation of Conflux; ecosystem contributors are the community of users who continuously generate value for the Conflux ecosystem.

Economic incentivizing mechanisms currently operate on the Conflux Network as follows:

**#1: Conflux users are incentivized to [stake their CFX tokens](https://governance.confluxnetwork.org/en/) with interest payments.** 
Staking plays an important role in securing the Conflux Network. Therefore, users who stake CFX receive interest payments at a [fixed, annualized rate of roughly 4%](https://medium.com/conflux-network/conflux-economic-model-staking-collateral-for-storage-on-conflux-network-cb4c8c150e3#:~:text=On%20Conflux%20Network%2C%20users%20can,approximately%2063%2C072%2C000%20blocks%20per%20year.). These payments are added to the user’s holdings at the time the tokens are “un-staked” (i.e., when the tokens are converted back to a liquid state).

Staking rewards are generated from the issuance of additional CFX tokens. When users do not stake their tokens, their interest payments go to Conflux’s public fund. Therefore, these interest payments implicitly shift value from those who do not stake to those who do.

**#2: Conflux users are incentivized to eliminate unnecessary data storage with bonded storage.** 
To deploy a smart contract on Conflux, a user is charged Collateral for Storage (CFS) when the data is written. In other words, smart contract deployers must lock tokens into the Conflux Network at a rate of 1 CFX per 1 kilobyte of data. Only [specific kinds of transactions](https://medium.com/conflux-network/conflux-economic-model-staking-collateral-for-storage-on-conflux-network-cb4c8c150e3#:~:text=The%20compound%20interest%20is%20implemented,interest%20rate%20is%20about%204.08%25.) require Collateral for Storage (CFS).

Because bonded tokens are staked, they generate interest. However, the payments are sent to miners instead of smart contract deployers. As a result, the deployers of the smart contracts are disincentivized to keep unnecessary data on the network, while the miners that maintain the network are incentivized to keep up their work. This prevents network congestion. If a smart contract deployer wants to release tokens from bonded storage, they must move data off of the Conflux blockchain.

**#3: Conflux users are incentivized to participate in governance with interest payments.** 
To obtain **voting rights** on Conflux, users agree to lock CFX tokens into the network for a fixed period of time, measured in quarters. To incentivize participation in governance, users retain staking rights for the tokens that have been locked for voting rights.

The number of votes that a user has is determined by two factors: the **amount of CFX** they have agreed to lock and the **amount of time** they have agreed to lock them for. This is calculated by multiplying the number of quarters by the number of tokens, and then multiplying the total by 0.25 (number of quarters × number of tokens × 0.25.) The maximum amount of time that tokens can be locked is four years.

- Locking maturity less than a quarter: No voting rights
- Locking maturity more than a quarter: One CFX has 0.25 vote
- Locking maturity more than half a year: One CFX has 0.5 vote
- Locking maturity more than a year: One CFX has 1 vote

## **Conflux Mining Rewards**

In addition to economic incentives for staking, Conflux also offers financial incentives for system maintainers or miners.

Due to Conflux’s Tree-Graph PoW consensus algorithm, miners play an important role in the network. Like Bitcoin miners, miners on Conflux receive financial rewards in exchange for the computing power that they contribute to maintaining the network. These rewards are earned in the form of block rewards and transaction fees.

When the Conflux mainnet was launched, the initial base block reward was set at 7 CFX per block, with blocks mined approximately every .5 seconds. Conflux’s block rewards are gradually reduced over time. However, instead of being cut in half, Conflux’s block rewards will be gradually reduced over measures of time called **epochs**. Epochs are phases in [the Tree-Graph’s life cycle](https://medium.com/conflux-network/understanding-the-conflux-tree-graph-consensus-algorithm-e1b57d5c3da9). Eventually, at epoch height 3,615,000, the Conflux block reward will be reduced to 2 CFX per block. There is currently no plan for a halving event since the block rewards are reduced. When the 4-year mark approaches, there will be a governance vote to see what should be done for the halving.

The distribution of block rewards includes a **disincentivizing mechanism** that punishes attackers. If an attacker attempts to generate a block of false transaction data (i.e. a [double-spend attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending)), the attacker will be hit with [a financial penalty.](https://medium.com/conflux-network/conflux-networks-economic-model-block-reward-components-under-the-network-s-mining-incentive-ceadd8f8408f)

Miners on Conflux also receive income in the form of interest payments. This interest income is generated from the Collateral for Storage (CFS) tokens that smart contract deployers must pay. As previously discussed, this interest is paid at an annualized rate of roughly 4%

## **The Role of the Conflux Foundation**

The tokenomics of the Conflux Network, including each of the economic incentivizing mechanisms described here, were initially designed by a non-profit organization known as the **Conflux Foundation.**

In the early stages of development, the Conflux Foundation existed to provide incentives to overcome the “cold start” problem; in other words, to promote participation and development in the network in its early stages. Today, the Conflux Foundation has the responsibility for making adjustments when allocating resources from the network’s equilibrium. Or, when the governance model decides on implementing a change to the network.

Since mainnet was launched in late 2020, the Foundation has been in charge of two funds that have aided in Conflux’s development: the Community Fund and the Ecosystem Fund. As the Network continues to grow, the Foundation plans to gradually transfer the governance of both of these funds to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) controlled by Conflux stakeholders. Therefore, over time, full control over the Conflux Network will be placed into the hands of users.
