title: What is Conflux?
---

Conflux is a public blockchain that stands out for its exceptional performance, scalability, decentralization, and security. It uses a unique combination of consensus mechanisms, Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), to maintain high security and throughput while ensuring a high degree of decentralization. The hybrid consensus mechanism is one of the key reasons behind Conflux's ability to process a large number of transactions with PoS providing finality.

Conflux's Tree-Graph ledger structure is another unique feature that enables fast block generation. The GHAST consensus algorithm, used in Conflux, enables all nodes in the blockchain network to agree consistently on a pivot chain of blocks by using the heaviest subtree rule on the parental tree in the ledger. It then reaches a consensus on the total order of all the blocks based on the pivot chain. This design ensures high throughput and security for the Conflux network.

With its Tree-Graph ledger structure and GHAST consensus algorithm, Conflux can achieve a high transaction throughput of up to 3000 TPS. This means that Conflux can process a significant number of transactions in a short period, making it a suitable blockchain for applications such as decentralized finance, gaming, and more. Conflux also employs a transaction sponsorship mechanism, where users can sponsor the transaction fee for others, allowing decentralized applications to absorb fees and create a better user experience.

Conflux has two distinct Spaces: Conflux Core Space and Conflux eSpace. Conflux Core Space is the main blockchain network that utilizes the hybrid consensus mechanism described above, while Conflux eSpace is fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that developers can easily migrate their existing Ethereum smart contracts to Conflux eSpace and take advantage of its high performance and scalability. Conflux Core Space and eSpace have the ability to communicate with each other via the CrossSpaceCall contract. This contract facilitates the transfer of funds and the execution of smart contract calls between the two spaces.
