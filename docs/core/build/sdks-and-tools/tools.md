Conflux has tools that can help developers quickly build a dapp.

## [hardhat-conflux](https://github.com/conflux-chain/hardhat-conflux)

Hardhat is the morden Solidity developer toolkit, which can also used to develop contracts on ConfluxNetwork with the [hardhat-conflux](https://github.com/conflux-chain/hardhat-conflux) plugin. This plugin brings to Hardhat the `js-conflux-sdk`, which allows you to interact with the Conflux blockchain in a simple way.
