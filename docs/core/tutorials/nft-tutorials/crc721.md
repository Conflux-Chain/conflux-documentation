# Creating and Deploying an ERC721 Contract on Conflux CoreSpace using Hardhat

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to create, write, and deploy an ERC721 NFT smart contract on Conflux CoreSpace using Hardhat. Additionally, it will show you how to view your contract on ConfluxScan.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- Node.js installed on your computer.
- A text editor, such as Visual Studio Code.
- A basic understanding of smart contract development and the Solidity programming language.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, you need to set up your development environment:
```bash
mkdir my-nft-project
cd my-nft-project
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Now, run the following command to create a Hardhat project:
```bash
npx hardhat
```
Choose the option to create a sample project and follow the prompts. After setting up, your project directory should include the Hardhat configuration files.

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

Install OpenZeppelin contracts, which provide a secure, audited implementation of ERC721 tokens:
```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## Step 3: Writing the Smart Contract

Create a new file named `MyNFT.sol` in the `contracts` folder and add the following Solidity code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    uint256 public nextTokenId;

    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {}

    function mint(address to, string memory uri) public onlyOwner {
        _safeMint(to, nextTokenId);
        _setTokenURI(nextTokenId, uri);
        nextTokenId++;
    }
}
```
This contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC721URIStorage and Ownable contracts to create an NFT that only the owner can mint.

## Step 4: Configuring Hardhat

Edit the `hardhat.config.js` to add the Conflux network configuration:

```javascript
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  networks: {
    corespace: {
      url: 'https://test.confluxrpc.com',
      accounts: ['YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE']
    }
  }
};
```
Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` with your private key.

## Step 5: Deploying the Contract

Create a deployment script in the `scripts` folder, named `deploy.js`:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const MyNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("MyNFT");
  const myNFT = await MyNFT.deploy();

  await myNFT.deployed();

  console.log("MyNFT deployed to:", myNFT.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

Deploy the contract by running:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network corespace
```

## Step 6: Verifying Your Contract on ConfluxScan

After deploying your contract, go to [ConfluxScan](https://confluxscan.io/), enter your contract address in the search bar, and you can view your contract's details, transactions, and more.

## Conclusion

This guide provided a step-by-step process for creating, deploying, and managing an ERC721 NFT on Conflux CoreSpace using Hardhat. By following these steps, you can launch your own NFT project on the Conflux network.
