## Overview

The `AdminControl` contract is a debug tool for contract development. When a contract is created during a transaction, the sender for the current transaction will become the contract admin automatically.

The `admin` address can transfer the administrator rights to another **normal address** or **zero address** by calling interface `setAdmin(address contractAddr, address newAdmin)`. **A contract can never be an admin**. 

The admin of a contract has several administrator rights. It can call interface `destroy(address contractAddr)` to destroy contract, just like a contract calling `suicide()` function. The SponsorWhitelist internal contract provides some functions can only be called by admin address. These functions can update the whitelist in sponsor mechanism. They will be introduced later. 

**Note: For all the interfaces requiring administrator rights, no matter the execution success or not, no error or exception will be triggered during internal contract execution.** For example, if a non-admin address tries to transfer the admin address to itself, this transaction will success but nothing will be changed. 

ConfluxScan may mark a contract as debug mode if the contract has non-zero admin address. **So remember, if you think the contract is ready for production environment, you should set admin address to zero.**


The `AdminControl` contract also provides a query interface `getAdmin(address contractAddr)` which can be called by anyone. 

**Corner cases:**
1. The admin is set at the start of contract creation. So if sender `A` creates contract `B` and set admin to `C` during contract construction, the admin will be `C` when the contract is deployed. 
2. However, if sender `A` calls contract `B`, then contract `B` creates contract `C` and then set admin to `D` during contract contraction, then the set will fail because the admin of `C` is `A` and the sender for creating `C` is `B`. 
3. But, Conflux introduces a special policy. In case 2, if `D` is zero address, the set admin will success. **This means that a contract can declare "I don't need admin" during contract creation.**

## Interface

AdminControl's hex40 address is `0x0888000000000000000000000000000000000000`, with interface:

```js
pragma solidity >=0.4.15;

contract AdminControl {
    /*** Query Functions ***/
    /**
     * @dev get admin of specific contract
     * @param contractAddr The address of specific contract
     */
    function getAdmin(address contractAddr) public view returns (address) {}
    
    /**
     * @dev Contract admin set the administrator of contract `contractAddr` to `newAdmin`.
     * @param contractAddr The address of the contract
     * @param newAdmin The new admin address
     */
    function setAdmin(address contractAddr, address newAdmin) public {}

   /**
     * @dev Contract admin destroy contract `contractAddr`.
     * @param contractAddr The contract to be destroied
     */
    function destroy(address contractAddr) public {}
}
```

## JS Example

Consider you have deployed a contract whose address is `contractAddr`. The administrator can call `AdminControl.setAdmin(contractAddr, new_admin)` to change the administrator and call `AdminControl.destroy(contractAddr)` to kill the contract. 

```javascript
const { Conflux } = require('js-conflux-sdk');

function main() {
    const cfx = new Conflux({
    url: 'https://test.confluxrpc.com',
    networkId: 1,
    });

    const PRIVATE_KEY = '0xxxxxxx';
    const account = cfx.wallet.addPrivateKey(PRIVATE_KEY); // create account instance

    const adminContract = cfx.InternalContract('AdminControl');

    // make sure account is the admin of contractAddr
    const contractAddr = 'cfxtest:acepe88unk7fvs18436178up33hb4zkuf62a9dk1gv';

    // to change administrator
    adminContract.setAdmin(contractAddr, new_admin).sendTransaction({
    from: account,
    }).executed();

    // to kill the contract
    adminContract.destroy(contractAddr).sendTransaction({
    from: account,
    }).executed();
}

main();
```
