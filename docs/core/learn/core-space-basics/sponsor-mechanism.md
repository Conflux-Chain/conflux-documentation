Conflux implements a sponsorship mechanism to subsidize the usage of smart contracts. Thus, a new account with zero balance is able to call smart contracts as long as the execution is sponsored (usually by the operator of Dapps). The built-in SponsorControl contract is introduced to record the sponsorship information of smart contracts. Refer to [SponsorWhitelistControl](./internal-contracts/sponsor-whitelist-control.md) for more information.
