# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

Installation:

```
$ yarn
```

Running:

```bash
$ yarn start
// or for zh site preview
// BUT DON'T DIRECTLY PROVIDE ZH TRANSLATION THIS WAY
$ yarn zh
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Build:

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
